## Projects
### Analyzing Students'Mental Health
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Performed exploratory data analysis on {students} dataset using **PostgreSQL** to determine if international students are at a higher risk of mental health difficulties compared to the general population. The average of total scores for depression, social connectedness, and acculturative stress were obtained and compared relative to the length of stay of international students at the university. Results showed nonlinear trend between length of stay and average depression score but generally followed a direct relationship, indicating that international students who stayed the longest at the university suffer the greatest from depression. Meanwhile, length of stay and average social connectedness score showed a non-monotonic pattern. Average social connectedness scores for international students were low during their earlier years, began to reached its peak at a certain point in time, then started to drop at later years. As for acculturative stress, it showed a fluctuating relationship with length of stay. Nonetheless, average acculturative stress tend to lower as length of stay increases.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
